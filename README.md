## How I worked on this project

Hello again dear friends.
Well, this lovely project came to me with an idea from the love of my life, and I started building it.
First, I spent time designing the components and putting them in a page inside Figma. (My friends, believe me, Figma is great :))
Then, by designing the component piece with my good friend, React, and then working on the flow of the app and the states and connecting my good state manager Zustand  to  the Api and tested  then debug the app ...

## Why I build this project anyway

I'm about to make a good resume to enter the job market and earn money through the knowledge I have.
This project, in addition to being my interest, also includes this goal.

## If I had more time I would change this

This app uses React Router to root and route the app, but as part of being a client side, it has its own problems. Maybe in the near future I will try to render this app on the server (ssr) using Flask or maybe Node.js for this ...
